This repository contains the code for the testing done on http://px300579.enjin.com/<br>
All HTML and JavaScript code has now been combined into one file (PX-Test 1) as the code editor does accept both types of code in the same editor despite recommendations to separate it into their respective module editors.


<ul>
<li>PX-Test 1 contains the majority of the code, to display and retrieve Google Analytics data such as graphs, and tables, and the OAUTH authorization code. This page now combines all HTML containers and JavaScript on the same page.</li>
<li>createGoal stores the code that inserts a goal and its properties from a website </li>
<li>Analytics tracking code is the code needed to enable tracking of the website from GA. This is code inserted into every 'head' tag of the test site and lies in a separate coding editor. </li>
</ul>
